# graphl-admin-react

This is a rewrite of [graphql-admin](https://github.com/gaslight/graphql-admin) in React. So far, basic queries and mutations including arguments
are working. Next up will be InputObjects (which don't work yet).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
